  SERVICES
    Descriptions and parameters of available services.

    retention
        Fail when the number of full backups is less than the
        "--retention-full" argument.

        Fail when the newest backup is older than the "--retention-age"
        argument.

        Fail when the newest full backup is older than the
        "--retention-age-to-full" argument.

        The following units are accepted (not case sensitive): s (second), m
        (minute), h (hour), d (day). You can use more than one unit per
        given value.

        Arguments are not mandatory to only show some information.

    archives
        Check if all archived WALs exist between the oldest and the latest
        WAL needed for the recovery.

        This service requires the "--repo-path" argument to specify where
        the archived WALs are stored.

        The "--repo-host" and "--repo-host-user" arguments allow to list
        remote archived WALs using SFTP.

        The "--repo-s3" enables remote archived WALs stored in Amazon S3.

        The "--repo-s3-over-http" switch to HTTP connection instead of
        HTTPS.

        Archives must be compressed (.gz). If needed, use "compress-level=0"
        instead of "compress=n".

        Use the "--wal-segsize" argument to set the WAL segment size.

        The following units are accepted (not case sensitive): b (Byte), k
        (KB), m (MB), g (GB), t (TB), p (PB), e (EB) or Z (ZB). Only
        integers are accepted. Eg. "1.5MB" will be refused, use "1500kB".

        The factor between units is 1024 bytes. Eg. "1g = 1G =
        1024*1024*1024."

        Use the "--ignore-archived-before" argument to ignore the archived
        WALs generated before the provided interval. Used to only check the
        latest archives.

        Use the "--ignore-archived-after" argument to ignore the archived
        WALs generated after the provided interval.

        The "--latest-archive-age-alert" argument defines the max age of the
        latest archived WAL as an interval before raising a critical alert.

        The following units are accepted as interval (not case sensitive): s
        (second), m (minute), h (hour), d (day). You can use more than one
        unit per given value. If not set, the last unit is in seconds. Eg.
        "1h 55m 6" = "1h55m6s".

        All the missing archives are only shown in the `--debug` mode.

    check_pgb_version
        Check if this script is running a given version.

        You must provide the expected version using "--target-version".
